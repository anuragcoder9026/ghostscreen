2. **Know Your Hotkey**: Practice using the toggle hotkey so it becomes second nature
3. **Prepare Your Workspace**: Set up your hidden apps before the interview starts
4. **Keep Reference Materials Ready**: Have documentation and notes in hidden windows for quick access

## Key Benefits

- **Instant Privacy Control**: Hide and show apps with a single keypress

        content: `GhostScreen uses a unique Time Coin system that gives you complete control over your usage and costs. Unlike traditional subscriptions, you only pay for what you use.

## How Time Coins Work

One Time Coin equals one minute of active stealth mode. Coins are only consumed when GhostScreen's hiding feature is actively enabled, giving you precise control over your spending.

## Purchasing Time Coins

We offer flexible packages to suit different needs:
- **Starter Pack**: 100 coins for quick sessions
- **Professional Pack**: 500 coins with 100 bonus coins
- **Power User Pack**: 1000 coins with 300 bonus coins (Best Value!)

## Managing Your Coins

Your Time Coin balance is visible in your dashboard, and you'll receive notifications before running low. Coins never expire, so you can purchase in bulk and use them at your own pace.

## Tips for Efficient Usage

- Only activate stealth mode when actively sharing your screen
- Use the hotkey toggle to quickly enable/disable as needed
- Monitor your coin balance in the dashboard
- Purchase larger packages for better value and bonus coins

The Time Coin system ensures you're always in control of your privacy budget.`,

        excerpt: "Explore how screen sharing technology is evolving to prioritize user privacy and security.",
        content: `Screen sharing has become an integral part of modern work and education. As we look to the future, privacy-first solutions are becoming increasingly important.

## The Current State

Today's screen sharing tools are powerful but often lack granular privacy controls. Users must choose between sharing their entire screen or individual windows, with little middle ground.

## Emerging Trends

### AI-Powered Privacy

Future solutions may use AI to automatically detect and hide sensitive information in real-time, adapting to context and user preferences.

### Selective Transparency

Advanced filtering could allow you to share specific regions of your screen while keeping others private, all in real-time.

### Blockchain-Based Verification

Decentralized verification systems could ensure that screen sharing sessions are secure and participants are authenticated.

## GhostScreen's Vision

At GhostScreen, we're pioneering privacy-first screen sharing with:
- Instant selective hiding
- Universal platform compatibility
- User-controlled privacy settings
- Minimal performance impact

## What's Next

We're working on exciting features including:
- Multi-monitor selective privacy
- Automated app detection
- Enhanced performance optimization
- Cross-platform support (macOS and Linux coming soon!)

## The Privacy Revolution

As remote work becomes permanent for many, privacy-first screen sharing isn't just a luxury - it's a necessity. The future belongs to solutions that put users in control of their digital privacy.

Join us in building this future with GhostScreen.`,
